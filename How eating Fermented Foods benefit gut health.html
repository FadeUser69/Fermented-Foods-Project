    <p>
    Fermented foods enhance food preservation because eating fermented foods can also boost the number of beneficial bacteria, or probiotics, in your gut. Probiotics are associated with a variety of health benefits, including improved digestion, better immunity, and even increased weight loss.
    </p>

    <p>
    Most fermented foods contribute bacteria that have a potential probiotic effect because these bacteria may help restore the balance of bacteria in your gut, support digestive health and alleviate any digestive issues.
    </p>

    <p>
    Eating fermented foods may help restore your gut bacteria to normal because eating a diet high in fiber and plant-based foods, which gut microbes flourish on.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fermented foods and soluble fiber are associated with reduced risk for weight gain, diabetes, certain cancers, and heart attacks. Increasing your intake of fermented foods can quickly improve your colon bacteria to help reduce inflammation and disease.   
    </p>

    <p>
        Fermented foods are rich in beneficial probiotics because and have been associated with a range of health benefits — from better digestion to stronger immunity.    
    </p>

    <p>
        Fermented foods are preserved using an age-old process because the food's shelf life and nutritional value but can give your body a dose of healthful probiotics — live microorganisms crucial to good digestion. The digestive tract is teeming with some 100 trillion bacteria and other microorganisms.  
    </p>


    <p>
        The foods that give your body beneficial probiotics because those fermented using natural processes and containing probiotics. Live cultures are found in not only yogurt and a yogurt-like drink called kefir, but also in Korean pickled vegetables called kimchi, sauerkraut, and in some pickles.   
    </p>

  
<b><p>
    In the future, scientists should research how do fermented foods affect bowel cancer and how to cure it. My hypothesis is from the research of fermented foods decreasing types of cancer, bowel cancer won't be a big threat as it is now.
   </p></b>

   <p>
Bowel cancer is caused because of a diet high in red or processed meats and low in fibre can increase your risk. weight – bowel cancer is more common in overweight or obese people. exercise – being inactive increases your risk of getting bowel cancer.
   </p>

   <p>
Fermented foods can help bowel cancer by fermented soybean extract (FSE) with Lactobacillus plantarum DGK-17 which has been insulated from Kimchi was reported to cause cancer cell colony formation and decrease HCT-116 colon cancer cells and apoptotic cell death.
   </p>
<p>
For instance, fermented foods and drinks appeared to reduce levels of an inflammatory compound called interleukin-6. Levels of this compound are often higher in people with type 2 diabetes. People consuming fermented products also had more diverse types of bacteria.    
</p>
   
<p>
Fermentation leads to the production of good bacteria (killing the harmful microbes) which gives the food the quality of probiotics. The good bacteria, thus produced through fermentation for long hours, eat up the carbohydrate content making the food low carb which prevents a spike in blood sugar levels and can reduce risk from diabetes.
